# WHID
An app/service for remembering what you've done, tracking what you're doing, and figuring out what you might do next.

## Philosophy
I want to know what I've been doing. A habit tracker of sorts, that does not get in the way or obligate me to add an extra inconvenience to the set up / tear down involved in my activities. Ease of access, with all the details necessary, and none unnecessary.

### Basics
-  **Things** that you are doing
- **Noting** if and when things are done
  - **Thing** you've done
  - **When** you did it
  - **Where** you did it
  - **Thoughts** on it

## User Stories

### Where did I leave off
I want to know at what point in a chapter, project, (sub)task, I left off and what I might be doing next. Not sure whether this ought to be a integrated into each event, have a separate type of event, or have a separate type of **thing** that will allow this (e.g. I may not care where I leave off meditating (*thought I suppose I may*) where as with a book, project, etc. I may want to check what the last thing I did exactly was so I know where to start again, but also can check progress).
