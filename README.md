# WHID
An app/service for remembering what you've done, tracking what you're doing, and figuring out what you might do next.

## Philosophy
I want to know what I've been doing. A habit tracker of sorts, that does not get in the way or obligate me to add an extra inconvenience to the set up / tear down involved in my activities. Ease of access, with all the details necessary, and none unnecessary.

### Basics
-  **Things** that you are doing
- **Noting** if and when things are done
  - **Thing** you've done
  - **When** you did it
  - **Where** you did it
  - **Thoughts** on it
